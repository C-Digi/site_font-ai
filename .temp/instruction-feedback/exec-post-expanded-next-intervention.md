# Instruction Feedback: exec-post-expanded-next-intervention`n`n## Readiness Check`n- Status: READY`n- Confidence: 0.95`n- Risk Level: low`n- Assumptions: `n    - common_coverage=68 is directionally reliable.`n    - v3_2 precision dip likely from vibe over-extension.`n    - recall gain likely from geometric inclusivity.`n`n## Ambiguities & Resolutions`n- **Ambiguity**: "VIBE OVER-EXTENSION GUARDRAIL" is a direction, not a specific string.`n- **Resolution**: I will look for specific failure patterns in v3_2 results (where it likely over-generalized playful queries) to formulate the exact patch text.`n- **Ambiguity**: Exact command plan.`n- **Resolution**: Will use standard research/ab-eval/py/run_all.py or similar as per project conventions found in artifacts.`n`n## Missing Inputs`n- None identified at start.`n`n## Conflicts`n- None identified.
