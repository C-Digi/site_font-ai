      "thought": "The font is a highly stylized display typeface constructed from horizontal line segments, creating a strong 'scanline', CRT, or digital interference effect. While it appears to follow a monospaced grid, the heavy horizontal banding severely compromises legibility at text sizes, positioning it firmly as a decorative font for headers or techno-themed graphics rather than functional text. The aesthetic is retro-futuristic and electronic. | The visual texture consists of digital scanlines (seen in the 'Contrast & Rhythm Strip'), which evokes electronics, screens, and cyberpunk themes.

A classic typewriter font requires a monospaced architecture (fixed width), uniform stroke thickness (low contrast), and typically sturdy slab serifs to mimic mechanical ribbon output. | The font displays extreme stroke contrast with hairline serifs (see 'A', 'b') and proportional spacing (the 'm' in 'jumps' is much wider than the 'i' in 'quick'), which contradicts the monospaced, monolinear slab-serif architecture required for a typewriter aesthetic.",
