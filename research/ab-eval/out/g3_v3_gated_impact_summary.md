## Notable Examples of Improvement
- **Hubballi** for **cq_009**: Corrected from 0 to 1. Evidence: The terminals of the 'C', 'S', and '2' are clearly rounded rather than blunt, and the single-story 'a' and 'g' provide a friendly, schoolbook-like appearance.
- **Manuale** for **cq_016**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The low stroke contrast and thick, blocky serifs (visible in the large 'Abg') create a utilitarian and sturdy aesthetic rather than the refined, high-contrast elegance typical of luxury branding.
- **Babylonica** for **cq_038**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The dry-brush texture creates jagged, scratchy edges on all characters, particularly visible in the large 'A' and 'g' specimens, which contradicts the 'gentle' requirement.
- **Xanh Mono** for **cq_029**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The font is monospaced with slab serifs, visible in the 'Legibility Pairs' and 'Contrast & Rhythm Strip'.
- **Anek Latin** for **cq_040**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The font is clearly proportional; in the lowercase alphabet string, characters like 'i' and 'l' occupy significantly less horizontal space than 'm' and 'w'.
- **Londrina Sketch** for **cq_003**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The letterforms feature irregular, hand-drawn outlines (visible in the 'Abg' sample) which directly contradict the 'industrial' requirement for precision.
- **Playwrite US Trad Guides** for **cq_010**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The 'Contrast & Rhythm Strip' and the large 'Abg' specimen show a uniform, monolinear stroke width with no visible variation between upstrokes and downstrokes.
- **Antic Slab** for **cq_033**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The zero '0' lacks a slash or internal dot, which is a primary technical requirement for a dedicated coding font to ensure clear distinction from the letter 'O'.
- **LXGW WenKai Mono TC** for **cq_009**: Corrected from 0 to 1. Evidence: The terminals are clearly rounded (visible in the 'l', 'i', and 'f'), and the slightly irregular, handwritten quality creates a friendly, approachable vibe suitable for a children's brand.
- **Esteban** for **cq_016**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The font lacks the high-contrast 'hairline' serifs and extreme vertical stress characteristic of luxury branding (e.g., Didot or Bodoni); it feels more like a book face than a fashion face.
