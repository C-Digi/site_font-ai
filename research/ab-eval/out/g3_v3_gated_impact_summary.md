## Notable Examples of Improvement
- **Manuale** for **cq_016**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The stroke contrast is moderate and the serifs are relatively thick and sturdy (visible in the 'A' and 'b'), which lacks the high-contrast 'sparkle' and delicate refinement typically required for luxury branding.
- **Playwrite US Trad Guides** for **cq_010**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The 'Contrast & Rhythm Strip' at the bottom of the second specimen clearly shows a series of slanted strokes with perfectly uniform thickness.
- **Esteban** for **cq_016**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The font lacks the high stroke contrast and hairline serifs (Didone style) typically associated with modern luxury branding; its proportions are optimized for legibility and 'bookish' heritage rather than 'chic' display use.
- **LXGW WenKai Mono TC** for **cq_009**: Corrected from 0 to 1. Evidence: The terminals are soft and rounded, and the hand-drawn quality creates a friendly, informal vibe suitable for a children's brand.
- **Antic Slab** for **cq_033**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: In the 'O0' legibility pair, the zero is distinguished only by its narrower width; it lacks a slash or internal dot, which is the standard requirement for 'clear distinction' in coding fonts.
- **Babylonica** for **cq_038**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: The jagged, scratchy outlines and erratic stroke weights visible in the large 'Abg' and the uppercase alphabet create a harsh, distressed texture that contradicts the 'gentle' requirement.
- **Noto Serif Lao** for **cq_030**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: While technically a slab serif, it lacks the 'Western' aesthetic which typically requires either heavy 'Egyptian' proportions, reverse contrast, or the specific rugged bracketing found in Clarendon-style faces.
- **Rubik Storm** for **cq_024**: Corrected from 1 to 0. Evidence: While the texture uses a grid-like dot pattern, it is a halftone/distress effect rather than a clean 8-bit pixel grid; the underlying letterforms (like the 'f' and 'g') have organic curves and serifs inconsistent with 80s computer fonts.
- **Hubballi** for **cq_009**: Corrected from 0 to 1. Evidence: The terminals on characters such as 'l', 'i', and '1' are distinctly rounded rather than sharp. Additionally, the 'a' and 'g' in the style identifiers are single-story, which is a common typographic choice for children's educational and brand materials to increase friendliness and legibility.
- **Baloo Paaji 2** for **cq_009**: Corrected from 0 to 1. Evidence: The terminals on characters like 'l', '1', and 'b' are visibly rounded, and the 'g' has a soft, open loop, creating a friendly and safe aesthetic ideal for children's brands.
