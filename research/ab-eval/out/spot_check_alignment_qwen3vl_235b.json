The 'O' and '0' in the legibility pairs are not perfect circles, and the 'i', 'l', '1', 'I' are not designed with the neutral, geometric precision expected.

The 'O' and '0' in the Legibility Pairs are not perfect circles\u2014they are slightly elliptical or have subtle stress. Stroke variation is visible in characters like 'A' and 'M', which have thicker and thinner parts, violating the 'low stroke variation' criterion.

The font\u2019s informal charm and visual quirkiness align well with the 'playful and quirky display font' requirement, despite not being overly cartoonish.

The specimen shows no such characteristics \u2014 the letterforms are neutral and modern, lacking the flair or historical reference expected.
