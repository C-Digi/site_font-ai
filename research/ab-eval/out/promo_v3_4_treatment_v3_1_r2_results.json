      "evidence": "The specimen exhibits definitive typewriter traits: monospaced widths (the 'i' and 'l' occupy the same horizontal space as 'o'), slab serifs, and a distressed texture that simulates ink ribbon impact.",
      "thought": "The font is a textured slab serif designed to replicate the aesthetic of a vintage mechanical typewriter. It features monospaced architecture (evident in the equal spacing of narrow glyphs like 'i' and wide glyphs like 'm'), distinct slab serifs, and a roughened 'ink-bleed' edge quality that mimics ribbon transfer. The stroke contrast is very low, consistent with monolinear typewriter keys. | The specimen exhibits definitive typewriter traits: monospaced widths (the 'i' and 'l' occupy the same horizontal space as 'o'), slab serifs, and a distressed texture that simulates ink ribbon impact.",
