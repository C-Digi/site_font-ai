The Contrast Strip at the bottom shows uniform vertical strokes, confirming this is a monoline script with consistent stroke weight throughout. It lacks the geometric construction and perfect circles required for query 1, and is definitively not a sans-serif (letters have script/cursive construction with entry/exit strokes). For query 3, while it is a script, it lacks the varying line weight (thick/thin contrast) characteristic of traditional calligraphic hands like Copperplate or Spencerian. However, the gentle, flowing curves, romantic loops, and elegant but readable cursive style make it well-suited for wedding invitations (query 4).",

It is NOT a sans-serif font - it has connected, calligraphic strokes with varying baselines and organic curves. For query 1, this fails completely as it is not a 'rounded sans' (which refers to sans-serif fonts with rounded corners like VAG Rounded). For query 3, this lacks all art deco characteristics: no geometric construction, no sharp angles, no high contrast, no vertical emphasis, and no 1920s symmetry - instead featuring fluid, asymmetrical, organic forms. For query 2, this matches well: it is a display font (illegible at small sizes as shown in the 6pt sample), has playful handwritten personality with quirky letterforms (swash capitals, looped descenders on g/y, irregular stroke flow), and the friendly, informal script style would suit a candy shop brand.",

The legibility pairs section demonstrates typical calligraphic distinction challenges (il1I, rn/m similarities). For query 1, this matches 'traditional calligraphic hand with varying line weight' as it emulates traditional Copperplate/Spencerian calligraphic hands with clear stroke contrast. For query 2, the elegant, flowing curves and romantic flourishes make it perfectly suited as a 'gentle script for wedding invitations' - a common use case for this style of formal, high-contrast script.",

Critical legibility failures are visible in the 'Legibility Pairs': the lowercase 'l', uppercase 'I', and number '1' appear nearly identical (all vertical strokes with serifs), while 'O' and '0' are indistinguishable ovals. For query 1, this refined, elegant typeface lacks the bold weight, rugged texture, or stencil characteristics required for outdoor camping display. For query 2, it fails both criteria: it is not monospace (characters have varying widths), and it performs poorly on distinguishability of critical character pairs (il1I, O0) essential for data table clarity.",
