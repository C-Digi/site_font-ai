Its aesthetic leans heavily towards retro-industrial, athletic, or 1970s tech styles. The design is strictly display-oriented; the internal inline detail compromises legibility at smaller sizes, and the character widths are proportional, not fixed. While it projects strength and durability suitable for branding, it lacks the specific elegance of Art Deco or the functional constraints of a coding/data font. | The font is not monospaced; the 'M' and 'W' are significantly wider than the 'I' or 'L' in the alphabet listing.
