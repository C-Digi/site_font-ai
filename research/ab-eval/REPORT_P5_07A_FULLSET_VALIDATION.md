# REPORT_P5_07A_FULLSET_VALIDATION — Full-Set Representativeness Validation

- **Run ID:** `p5_07a_fullset_candidate`
- **Date (UTC):** 2026-02-14T08:01:07Z
- **Variant ID:** `p5_07a_fullset_candidate`
- **Baseline:** `v3`
- **Decision:** **NO-GO** (Global Promotion Gate Fail: G4 Pending)

## Executive Summary
This report presents the full-set validation (247 pairs) for the `P5-06B-R2` rank-boundary-aware intervention strategy. While the strategy showed a significant **Directional GO** in P5-06B, this full-set run confirms its representativeness across the entire SSoT. 

The intervention produced a **+3.24% Agreement Delta** on the full set, successfully passing G1, G2, and G3. However, overall status is **NO-GO** as G4 (Visual QA) remains PENDING and requires manual verification.

## Global Metrics Table

| Variant | Agreement | Precision | Recall | F1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `v3` (Baseline) | 0.2955 | 0.1623 | 0.6889 | 0.2627 |
| `p5_07a_fullset_candidate` | 0.3279 | 0.1832 | 0.7778 | 0.2966 |
| **Delta** | **+0.0324** | **+0.0209** | **+0.0889** | **+0.0339** |

## Gate Status (Acceptance Criteria)

| Gate | Metric | Status | Value | Threshold |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **G1** | Agreement Delta | **PASS** | +0.0324 | >= +1.0% |
| **G2** | Precision Delta | **PASS** | +0.0209 | >= -2.0% |
| **G3** | Helps/Hurts Net | **PASS** | +8 | > 0 |
| **G4** | Visual QA | **PENDING** | Manual | Zero clipping/overlap |

## Per-Query-Class Breakdown

| Query Class | Pairs | Helps | Hurts | Net |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `visual_shape` | 58 | 4 | 2 | +2 |
| `semantic_mood` | 66 | 11 | 5 | +6 |
| `historical_context` | 58 | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| `functional_pair` | 65 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

## Helps/Hurts Analysis (Boundary Flip Diagnostics)

- **Total Boundary Flips:** 34
- **Helps:** 21 (Successful demotions of hard-negatives or promotions of true-positives)
- **Hurts:** 13 (Regressions where valid fonts were demoted or invalid ones promoted)
- **Net Impact:** +8

### Top Helps (Successes)
- **cq_003 (Goblin One):** Successfully demoted from Top-10 (Motif: `over_strict_semantic`).
- **cq_012 (Albert Sans):** Successfully demoted from Top-10 (Motif: `over_strict_semantic`).
- **cq_024 (Jersey 20):** Successfully promoted to Top-10.

### Top Hurts (Regressions)
- **cq_021 (Bentham):** Regression in `historical_context` (Motif: `vintage_era`).
- **cq_025 (Bungee Inline):** Regression in `historical_context` (Motif: `vintage_era`).

## Interpretation: Directional Slice vs Full-Set
The full-set validation confirms that the rank-boundary-aware scaling mechanism is effective beyond the curated directional slice. The **+3.24% Agreement gain** is significantly higher than the +1.0% threshold, suggesting the intervention generalizes well.

However, the `historical_context` (vintage) class remains volatile with a net 0 impact, repeating the observation from P5-06B that `vintage_era` penalties are less effective or more prone to collateral damage than `over_strict_semantic` penalties.

## Governance & Policy Statement
Governance semantics remain **unchanged**. This run serves as a representativeness check. Global promotion to production would still require manual G4 clearance and a formal ADR.
