# P5-06A Directional Intervention Trial Report

- **Run ID:** `p5_06a_directional_candidate`
- **Date (UTC):** 2026-02-14T07:15:22.645872+00:00
- **Variant ID:** `p5_06a_directional_candidate`
- **Baseline:** `v3`
- **Decision:** **NO-GO** (Directional Evidence Only)

## Scope and Policy Note

This artifact is a **bounded offline directional intervention trial** using the coverage-remediated balanced slice from P5-05C. It is **not** a global promotion trial, and G1/G2/G3/G4 governance semantics remain unchanged.

## Preflight Inputs

- `research/ab-eval/out/full_set_review_export_1770612809775.json`
- `research/ab-eval/out/g3_v3_gated_results.json`
- `research/ab-eval/data/queries.medium.human.v1.json`
- `research/ab-eval/data/corpus.200.json`
- `research/ab-eval/out/week4_p3_hurts_rootcause.json`

## Execution Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Seed | `42` |
| Repeats | `1` |
| Label Policy | `2->0` remap |
| Target Total | `12` |
| Target Per Motif | `6` |
| Vintage Penalty | `-0.12` |
| Strict Penalty | `-0.10` |

## Selection Summary

- **Hard-Negative Definition:** `human==0` (after remap) AND baseline `v3` rank <= 10
- **Targeted Motifs:** `over_strict_semantic`, `vintage_era`
- **Pool Counts:** `vintage_era=32`, `over_strict_semantic=17`, `total=49`
- **Selected Counts:** `over_strict_semantic=6`, `vintage_era=6`
- **Selected Total:** `12` (balanced slice from P5-05C)

## Global Metrics Table

| Variant | Agreement | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `v3` (baseline) | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| `p5_06a_directional_candidate` | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |

**Note:** All selected pairs are hard-negatives (human=0) with baseline prediction=1, resulting in FP=12 for both variants. The intervention penalties did not change the top-10 membership for any pair.

## Gate Status

| Gate | Status | Value | Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G1 (Agreement Delta)** | **FAIL** | 0.0000 | >= +1.0% |
| **G2 (Precision Delta)** | **PASS** | 0.0000 | >= -2.0% |
| **G3 (Helps/Hurts Net)** | **FAIL** | 0 | > 0 |
| **G4 (Visual QA)** | **PENDING** | Manual | Zero clipping/overlap |

## Per-Query-Class Breakdown

| Query Class | Pairs | Helps | Hurts |
|---|---|---|---|
| `visual_shape` | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| `historical_context` | 6 | 0 | 0 |

## Helps/Hurts Analysis

- **Helps Count:** 0
- **Hurts Count:** 0
- **Net:** 0

No ranking changes occurred that would alter top-10 membership for the selected hard-negative pairs. The penalty magnitudes (0.10-0.12) were insufficient to overcome the baseline confidence scores (all 1.0) and produce boundary flips.

## Qualitative Notes

1. **Penalty Magnitude Insufficiency:** The applied penalties (`vintage_era=-0.12`, `over_strict_semantic=-0.10`) were too small relative to the baseline confidence scores to produce ranking changes within the top-10 boundary.

2. **Baseline Confidence Saturation:** All selected pairs had baseline confidence of 1.0, creating a high bar for penalty-based demotion.

3. **Boundary Flip Opportunity:** The P5-05C audit identified 3 estimated boundary flip opportunities in the `cq_003` query window (ranks 8-12), but the current penalty magnitudes did not realize these opportunities.

4. **Directional Evidence Only:** This trial confirms that the current penalty strategy produces neutral results on the curated hard-negative slice. Stronger interventions (larger penalties, different scoring mechanisms) would be required to move the needle.

## Governance Semantics

**Unchanged.** This trial is a bounded offline directional intervention only. G1/G2/G3/G4 promotion gate semantics from `EVALUATION_CONTRACT.md` remain unchanged.
