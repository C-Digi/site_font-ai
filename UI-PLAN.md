## UI Design 

- Current UI is leftover from the MVP. we need to completely redo it from the ground up. 
- add to rules-project to use reactive design, must be optimized for both mobile and desktop 
- use frontend skill.

- implement light+dark mode toggle, dark by default
- our logo uses #00baf0 primarily - use this in the color scheme

- for the preview text input box
  - on page load, have it pre-populated with a relevant string (e.g. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." but more unique and interesting).
  - once clicked into the box, the pre-filled text should be automatically deleted so the user doesn't have to manually clear it out.
  - If the user sends the AI a chat message while the preview text input is still empty (not modified by user, preset selected), have AI insert a relevant string

Favorites
- add favorites toggle button on font cards
- add a RH collapsible sidebar with Favs list
  - subtle animation when a font is added/removed to favs
  - persist between sessions, even when not signed in

add a dismissable banner: `Leaving this page or closing the tab will clear the chat history.`
