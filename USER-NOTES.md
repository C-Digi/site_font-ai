- no free fonts, no free filter

## potential later features
- user-selectable attributes to make a 2D visualizer of fonts on a plot, e.g. business vs party on X scale, bold vs thin on Y scale
  - hover or zoom in to see previews of each point/font









## decided against

For those we 'hide' for premium, could we still render the font to preview and entice, but block the download button, name, and any revealing data? 
 - dont do this - its more enticing not seeing them, and risks the locked fonts discouraging them from using/spending
