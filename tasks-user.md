Now, every time Gemini suggests a font that   
  isn't in your Supabase database, the app automatically generates its embedding and saves it in  
  the background.

  To handle the Bulk Seeding, I've prepared a more robust version of the seeding script. To use   
  it, simply:
   1. Get a Google Fonts API Key from the Google Cloud Console
      (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   2. Add GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY=your_key to your .env.local.
   3. Run the command below (I've updated the script to handle 1,000+ fonts with the API). 

why stop at 1k - do all google fonts available (1,911 families according to UI)

are there other free APIs for font sources that would be good for this other than google fonts, which would have additional fonts google doesnt have? only free fonts.
